# Project Title: Employee Attrition Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to build a logistic regression model that predicts employee attrition at a company. The dataset used for this project is the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 35 columns and 1470 rows. The columns include demographic information such as age, gender, and marital status, job-related information such as job role, job level, and performance rating, and other information such as work-life balance, years with the company, and distance from home. The target variable is "Attrition," which indicates whether an employee has left the company or not.

## Approach
- Data Exploration and Preparation: This step involves understanding the data, identifying missing values and outliers, and preparing the data for modeling.
- Model Building: Logistic regression is used to build the prediction model. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
- Feature Importance: The importance of each feature in predicting employee attrition is evaluated using the coefficients of the logistic regression model.



## Tools and Libraries 
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy for data manipulation and preprocessing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation




## Conclusion
The logistic regression model built in this project can be used by companies to predict employee attrition and take necessary actions to prevent it. By identifying the factors that lead to attrition, companies can improve the work environment and retain their employees.
